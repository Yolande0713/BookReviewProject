      "The Fourth Money killer is the first twisted and terrifying book I have read. I could not put it down, I read it in one day. The storyline, the plot was captivating. The diary provided a lot of insight into the family dynamic. At first I thought it was just a typical loving family as the Fourth Monkey killer reiterate at the beginning of the diary.Things took a turn and everything become clear that this loving family has a big secret. I felt bad for him going through such traumatic experiences at a young age. He claimed his work is to punish those who do evil. Those were the rules his family run their life by. All of his victim were someone close to the transgressor. Either the father was embezzling money or mother was a terrible person. In this book he justify his action for not going directly after the transgressor because the real pain is seeing a father grief the death their child. There is a lot of unanswered question. The book end on a cliffhanger I am excited to see where this journey take us.",

He choose to enlist the help of the Black sorcerer. What did the Black sorcerer do when he see the white knight? He decided to keep him.",
    review:
      "I really enjoyed this book. It was fun lighthearted read. A white knight seeking the help of a dark sorcerer to save the people of the country from the princess's stupid decision. The character development was incredible in my opinion. The internal turmoil on Devan's about wether to leave his position as a knight and go be with his lover Tan or stay in his position and be miserable. The difficult part for his decision was that he loved his job and he spend years of his life protecting the country and did not want all the hard work to go in vain. Tan character seemed a bit juvenile but I do love the banter and how bad of villain he became when he was not acting like a child. I don't think there were anymore development on Tan character at the end of the book. Although in the end he have way more responsibility but he still have to be supervise, which I enjoy immensely. Their adventure together was easy and straight forward. I finished it in two days. It was a fun bedtime story.",

Donovan Havili, the most patient, generous, and kind man tend to give off the wrong first impression as he look like a thug due to his size and tattoos. Will Jon and Don back down when their case come to a dead end?",
    review:
      "A lot of the Sherwood books I have read so far are very lighthearted and downright ridiculously fun read. This book was one of the sweet, quirky and lovely. Few books I have read was very intense which cause me a lot of anxiety. The mystery in this book was not as intense in fact it was very relaxing to me. This is a great book to read after reading a heavy book or if you are like me who read just for the fun of it. This book is it. Jon job is dangerous as a psychic he works as a lie detector for the police department in the area. Donovan as Jon's bodyguard have had hard time making connection with people due to his intimidating size. However Jon was able to see Donovan's kindness, generosity and incredible patience. These two working together, learning about each other and always on the go. The case there were working on was very complicated, shooting that did not make sense, victim who is not what it seem. The result of this case was very unconventional. I loved the case. I definitely recommend this book.",

    review:
      "If you're looking for a relaxing fun read this may not be the best choice. This story takes place in a world and culture so far removed from what we are used to that many parts of the book are dedicated to exposition. This book is best for someone who enjoys place and situations that push the limits of human experience. It is a bit dense and confusing at times but if you go in with an open mind you will find this to be a great book!",

      "This sequel to Paul's story moves away from the adventure and action of the first book. It is much more vast in it's scope than the first book but still deals with many similar themes. It is definitely not a direct continuation of the first book. It was a harder to get excited about reading this book due to the amount of suspense and at times confusion put on the reader but the overall writing and story is still top tier.",

    review:
      "If you are a fan of either short stories or science fiction or just good story telling and world building look no further. Some of these stories I think about almost daily. The situations and imagination Asimov had for what the future may be like is truly amazing. Even though some of these stories are over 50 years old the lessons and messages still apply. The stories range from fun and goofy to serious and depressing but no matter what you can't help but be excited and surprised at every turn of the page",

We finally get a more detailed look into what life is like on Earth which is something I was really hoping for. We also get a look into what life is like on other parts of the solar system that are now being inhabited by humans. I also really liked how the human race starts to even move outside of the solar system, I wish that there was another series of books exploring that concept.",
